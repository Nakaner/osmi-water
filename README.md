# osmi-water
Read openstreetmap data and extract waterobjects, indicate logical and tagging errors. Output is sqlite. Designed for OSM Inspector (http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi).

Software is not in use now, but tested with the whole osm planet. Written in c++, it uses the new osmium framework (https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium). The source code can be used as an example how to use the libosmium.
